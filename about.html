                Ek saal phle, I saw you in Valence, pta nhi kaun sa floor, lekin the day I saw you, I lost myself.. I unknowingly followed you, jo aadmi 2 hafte me ek baar office aata tha, woh tumhare liye roz aane office aane laga! But suddenly tum kahi gayab ho gyi toh haa! Back to normal days, lekin the search for you had never stopped, I went to SF, AURA, EMINENCE, and ofc Velocity to find you lekin tummmm na, idiot, never found you only! Par ukw, the universe heard me, randomly you came to the 4th floor as SA, I was soo happy, uss din, I went back home, sat and actually prayed to the GOD ki aapko jo chahiye woh mujhse lelo, lekin please gift me her! Apna dil me sambhal kar rakhunga! Aur boht shiddat se pyaar karunga usse! Bhagwaan ne bhi sunn liya:<br>
                <strong>"Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho‚Ä¶ to poori kainath use tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai"</strong>, mere sath bhi wahi hua! July 17th you confessed! And uss din se aaj tak, I wake up to you, I live for you, I sleep to you! Last few weeks with you were my best days Sufi! We went out almost everyday, HSR, Indiranagar, BDA Complex, MG Road, Church Street, VV Puram, Kammanahalli, Airport, Hebbal, My place, raat ke 1 baje that medical store! I love you so much, kahani abhi khatam nhi hui h sweetheart! I wanna grow old with you, so, kahani to be continued..!
